# Tile library visual contract

This library owns tile artwork and catalog inspection. It has no Game Session,
Action Draft, authorization, history, or rules engine. Game hosts own those
contracts when composing these assets into a Game Client.

## Visual intents

- **Browse:** search and color/track/stop filters determine the visible catalog.
  Matching definitions retain their full identity, including same-number variants.
- **Inspect:** choosing a card marks that card and displays its enlarged tile,
  identity, labels, values, token capacity, and explicit track segments. Pointer,
  touch, Enter, and Space use the same native button interaction.
- **Rotate:** clockwise/counterclockwise controls change the inspected orientation
  by one sixth-turn. The inspection reports degrees and rotated edge numbers.
- **Change presentation:** orientation and style controls affect all tile views in
  that viewer. They preserve definition, rotation, and highlighted path identity.
- **Inspect a segment:** a segment button toggles emphasis on precisely that path.
  Every path has a separate button, including paths that cross visually.
- **Choose for a host:** an optional Use tile button emits the definition ID and
  rotation. Browsing, automatic initial inspection, rotation, and highlighting
  never emit this event. The host decides whether to stage a game interaction.

## Coexistence and precedence

Inspection chrome surrounds the card and does not recolor the tile. Path emphasis
coexists with card inspection, style, and rotation. It draws over normal track and
under stops/annotations. Selecting a different tile resets rotation and path
emphasis. Reset returns to rotation zero and clears segment emphasis.

Changing the filtered collection resets inspection to the first visible tile at
rotation zero, with no segment emphasis. An empty result shows an empty state and
offers Clear filters. No hidden selection can be emitted. Each viewer instance
owns independent browsing state.

## Shared visual state

The viewer owns inspection (definition ID, rotation, optional path ID), filters,
orientation, and appearance. The renderer consumes those values and owns none of
their lifecycle. Inspection is valid only within the current filtered definitions.
Its writable derived default is replaced when that collection changes. Mounting
a new viewer starts a fresh local inspection; presentation is not persisted.

The renderer's supplied highlighted path IDs refer to the unrotated definition's
stable path IDs. Layout hints adjust only visual positions/controls. They cannot
add paths, merge cities, or alter token capacity. The caller must supply a matching
face and drawing when using the lower-level SVG artwork component.

There is no library Back/Undo interaction. Live View, History View, replay, and
restoration remain host concerns: a game host supplies the intended face and
presentation inputs for the state it is showing. The library commits no Actions.

## Render ownership

Artwork owns the hex background, track, stops, token spaces, revenue, and city labels.
It also renders the port symbol and a rectangular badge for a face's upgrade cost.
That cost belongs to the current face; terrain and persistent rights remain map facts.
Tile identifiers appear in viewer metadata and accessible names, not on the tile.
Geometry comes from the shared model and Common hex
geometry in a radius-50 coordinate space. Text remains upright in both hex
orientations and all rotations. Appearance changes styling, not drawing topology.
Circular revenue markers choose among the six corners, avoiding track and other
content. Cities with three or more slots move their revenue farther toward the
corner for clearance in both orientations. The separate-city specimen supplies
revenue overrides at 0° and 180° in flat-top views and throughout pointy-top
rotation to keep each value associated with its city. Labels yield to revenues.
Ordinary edge-to-edge tracks are circular arcs, or straight lines for opposite
edges. Towns split the same geometry at their stop without changing its curvature.
Through-town positions can move along that curve, as on #56. Central junction
towns use larger round dots; Classic through-towns use bars. Independent two-town
tiles preserve distinct node/path identities.
All track borders render beneath all track strokes, so borders cannot cut through
the black track at junctions or crossings.

Hosts can compose a track-overlay snippet after track and before stops, and an
overlay snippet after stops and before annotations. Both receive the same drawing,
including rotated path/node/slot coordinates. Hosts own route overlays, tokens,
location names, and associated input handling; catalog definitions remain immutable.
The library's annotations do not intercept pointer input. A whole-tile SVG exposes
an accessible name; the group artwork relies on its containing SVG/host for naming.
Optional inventory counts appear beside cards and in inspection details. The host
supplies counts; filtering, rotating, and browsing never consume or return pieces.
The separate `apps/18xx-tile-viewer` development app selects complete TOP, standard
1889, or beginner 1889 sets. It owns game imports and title integration/browser
tests; this shared package has no game dependencies or imports.

## Verification scenarios

Browser tests exercise same-number search/inspection, rotation/reset, segment
emphasis, style changes preserving geometry, empty results, label clearance from
stops and revenues, and mobile keyboard interaction
without horizontal overflow. The specimen page exercises each tile in all six rotations, both orientations, and
both styles, plus caller-owned route/token/location overlays and 64/110/180-pixel
views. Geometry tests verify logical endpoints, slot capacity, continuous town
curves, circular radii and tangents, crossing/junction distinction, city/revenue
association, and explicit layout hints.
Inventory tests verify physical-piece conservation, paired faces, return/retirement,
title isolation, and serialized state. Browser tests verify full title counts,
beginner extras, port rendering, preprinted tiles, and replacement examples.

Visual review covers labeled T/X/CX cities, the two #611 definitions, crossings,
multiple independent cities, staged revenue, and enlarged/mobile views. The
standalone development host renders on the client so it does not expose controls
before event handlers are attached.
